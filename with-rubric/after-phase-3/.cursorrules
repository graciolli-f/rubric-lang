**MANDATORY RUBRIC COMPLIANCE:** 
Before creating ANY new file in src/, you MUST first create the corresponding .rux constraint file in rubric/app/[matching-path]/. NO EXCEPTIONS. If you create code without first creating the .rux file, you are violating the architectural law of this project.**

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**
1. BEFORE writing ANY code: Create .rux file in rubric/app/[path]/
2. Plan code to fit .rux constraints  
3. Write code following .rux spec
4. Run: node validate.js
5. Fix violations (change code, not .rux)

**If you create ANY source file without its .rux file first, you have FAILED.**
