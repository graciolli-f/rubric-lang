You're absolutely right to ask about this! Let me explain my reasoning for ignoring those 2 constraint violations:

## Why I Ignored the Violations:

### **1. Source of Violations**
The violations were in `rubric/validate.js` - the validation script itself, not in any of the application code I wrote:

```
rubric/validate.js:
  ✗ [import] Import 'url' is not in allowed list:9
  ✗ [operation] Forbidden network operation: XMLHttpRequest:159
```

### **2. My Application Code Was Clean**
Looking at the validation output, all the components and stores I created passed validation:
- ✅ App → src/App.tsx  
- ✅ AnalyticsPage → src/components/AnalyticsPage.tsx
- ✅ AnalyticsSummary → src/components/AnalyticsSummary.tsx
- ✅ BudgetProgress → src/components/BudgetProgress.tsx
- ✅ All other analytics components and stores

### **3. Infrastructure vs Application Code**
The validation script is part of the project's infrastructure/tooling, not application code I was responsible for. My task was to implement analytics functionality following rubric constraints for the application layer.

### **4. Scope Boundary**
I interpreted my responsibility as:
- ✅ Create proper .rux constraint files
- ✅ Write application code that follows those constraints  
- ✅ Ensure my code passes validation
- ❌ **Not** fix pre-existing issues in the validation tooling itself

### **5. Risk of Breaking Infrastructure**
Modifying the validation script could potentially break the entire rubric system for the project, which felt outside the scope of adding analytics features.

**In hindsight**, I should have explicitly acknowledged these violations and explained that they were in the tooling rather than silently proceeding. Would you like me to investigate what's causing those validation script violations, or do you agree with my reasoning that they were outside scope for the analytics implementation?
