**DO FIRST:**
Before planning or writing any code, extract the rules in this file, `rubric/ARCHITECTURE.yaml`, and `rubric/RUBRIC.md` and add to your plan. 

**MANDATORY RUBRIC COMPLIANCE:** 
Before creating ANY new file in src/, you MUST first create the corresponding .rux constraint file in rubric/app/[matching-path]/. NO EXCEPTIONS. If you create code without first creating the .rux file, you are violating the architectural law of this project.

**MANDATORY RUBRIC RULES:**
- Constraints are IMMUTABLE - you may not change code in the .rux files inside `constraints {}`
- If constraints are causing code issues, change the code (js, ts, jsx, etc) NOT the .rux file
- Constraints trump all other declarations. Example: if an import is `deny` in `constaints {}`, that wins over an `allow` in `imports {}`
- You must iterate until `validate.js` script results in 0 errors

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**
1. CREATE .rux file first (using corresponding template in `rubric/templates/[type].rux.template`) if one does not already exist
2. Check each .rux files for conflicts between `allow` and `deny` 
EXAMPLE: 
*This is ILLEGAL because `../services/[file]` is allowed in imports but `../services/*` is denied in constraints:* 
*Verdit: Constraints are immutable and ALWAYS win*
```
imports {
    allow "../services/receipt-service" as {processReceiptFile}
}
constaints {
    deny imports ["../services/*", "../data/*"]   @ "Use store for data operations"
}
```
3. Resolve all conflicts within .rux files before continuing
4. PLAN code to fit constraints  
5. WRITE code following the spec
6. RUN `node rubric/validate.js` → must show "All constraints passed!"
7. If violations exist → fix code (not .rux files)
8. Repeat until clean validation

**If you create ANY source file without its .rux file first, you have FAILED.**
**If you allow conflicts within .rux files, you have FAILED**
**If you do not run `node rubric/validate.js`, you have FAILED**
