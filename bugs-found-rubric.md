I'll analyze the codebase for the issues you mentioned. Let me systematically examine the code for memory leaks, module boundary violations, exposed private members, race conditions, and error handling issues.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Memory Leaks**

**In `ExpenseTrackerContainer.tsx`:**
- The component subscribes to store updates but doesn't have cleanup for potential async operations when unmounting
- Edit mode state (`editingExpenseId`) could cause stale closures if the component unmounts during editing

**In `currency-service.ts`:**
- The in-memory cache (`rateCache`) grows indefinitely without any cleanup mechanism
- No maximum size limit or TTL-based eviction strategy

**In `receipt-service.ts`:**
- Receipt images are stored in localStorage but there's no cleanup mechanism for orphaned receipts
- The `getStorageUsage()` function creates Blob objects without cleanup

### 2. **Module Boundary Violations**

**In `ExpenseTrackerContainer.tsx`:**
```typescript
// Directly manipulating form data that should be encapsulated
initialData={(() => {
  const expense = expenses.find(e => e.id === editingExpenseId);
  if (!expense) return undefined;
  return {
    amount: expense.amount,
    category: expense.category,
    date: expense.date,
    description: expense.description,
  };
})()}
```

**In `expense-store.ts`:**
- The store directly imports and uses services, creating tight coupling
- Business logic is mixed with state management (e.g., receipt deletion logic in `deleteExpense`)

### 3. **Race Conditions**

**In `auth-store.ts`:**
```typescript
login: async (data: LoginData) => {
  set({ isLoading: true, error: null });
  try {
    // Race condition: Multiple rapid login attempts could cause state inconsistency
    const mockUser: User = { /* ... */ };
    set({ 
      user: mockUser,
      isAuthenticated: true,
      isLoading: false,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // ...
  }
},
```

**In `ExpenseForm.tsx`:**
```typescript
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);
// Race condition between form submission and component unmount
const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  setIsSubmitting(true);
  try {
    onSubmit(formData);
    // No cleanup if component unmounts here
  } finally {
    setIsSubmitting(false); // This could run after unmount
  }
};
```

### 4. **Bad Error Handling**

**In `expense-store.ts`:**
```typescript
deleteReceipt: async (receiptId: string) => {
  try {
    set({ isLoading: true });
    await receiptService.deleteReceipt(receiptId);
    // What if this fails after receipt is deleted from service?
    set((state) => ({
      expenses: state.expenses.map(expense => /* ... */)
    }));
  } catch (error) {
    // Receipt might be deleted but expense still references it
  }
}
```

**In `currency-service.ts`:**
```typescript
getExchangeRate: async (fromCurrency: Currency, toCurrency: Currency): Promise<number> {
  try {
    // ...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to get exchange rate:', error);
    return 1; // Silent fallback could cause incorrect calculations
  }
}
```

### 5. **Exposed Private Members**

**In `expense.types.ts`:**
- All `Expense` properties are public when some should be read-only (e.g., `id`, `createdAt`)
- No distinction between internal and external representations

**In stores:**
- Direct state mutation is possible through returned references:
```typescript
getExpensesSortedByDate: () => {
  const { expenses } = get();
  return [...expenses].sort(/* ... */); // Good - returns copy
}

// But:
expenses: Expense[], // Directly exposed array reference
```

### 6. **Additional Issues**

**Type Safety Issues:**
```typescript
// In ExpenseItem.tsx
onSave={(id, data) => {
  // Comment says "handled by container" but type allows calling
}}
```

**Async State Management:**
```typescript
// In auth-store.ts
initializeAuth: async () => {
  await get().checkAuthStatus();
  // No error handling or loading state management
}
```

**localStorage Reliability:**
- Multiple components assume localStorage is always available
- No fallback for storage quota exceeded errors
- No data validation when reading from localStorage
