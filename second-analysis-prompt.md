I need you to write up a detailed analysis comparing the code bases from /base-llm, /best-practices, and /with-rubric.

I want you to analyze the progression of the code from phase 1 > phase 2 -> phase 3 -> phase 4 with a focus on the maintenance of the architectural integrity as the code base progressed from phase to phase. 

Keep in mind the following sentiment:
We want to find a balance between fast prototyping and over-engineering toward architecture. So, the best code base is not the one that is the most "proper," the best code base is the one that followed good architectural principles but did not add bloat, over-engineer solutions, avoided duplication, and kept bugs out. The idea is that of a layered architectural approach, where architectural decisions are made as the code base evolves and as is necessary. Also keep in mind the context that this is code built by AI. 

Include:
- Qualitative assessment of the code
- Quantitative data re: the code
- Analysis and commentary on architectural structure and integrity over time (as features were added) 
- For the with-rubric code, consider the rubric files progression and their effect on the code
- For the with-rubric code, consider the role that running validate.js played
- Whenever possible (do this often) use real code snippets as supporting evidence/examples. 
- Bugs introduced/found at each stage

Avoid emojis. Do not make assumptions. Do not make up data. Only use what you have access to. Ask clarifying questions if needed. Use this color palette, keep it professional. 

--color-primary: #3f4e4a;        /* Deep sage */
--color-primary-dark: #2d3733;   /* Darker sage */
--color-secondary: #8b9a94;      /* Mid sage */
--color-accent: #0284c7;         /* Sky blue */
--color-success: #059669;        /* Muted emerald */
--color-warning: #ea580c;        /* Muted orange */
--color-error: #dc2626;          /* Clear red */

The result should be 4 visually appealing html/css files inside the /claude-report/second-analysis/ folder. The files are: 
1) base-llm-only-analysis, 
2) best-practices-only-analysis, 
3) with-rubric-only-analysis, 
4) comparative-analysis

The data should be presented in an easy-to-digest, but comprehensive and accurate manner.
